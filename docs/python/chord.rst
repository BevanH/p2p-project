Chord Module
============

.. warning::

    This module is very unstable, and should be regarded as "pre-alpha".

    While it sometimes passes its unit tests, and it works slightly more often in a console window, this is far from an efficient distributed hash table.

    If you're considering using this, *please* wait until this warning is removed. Doing otherwise will give a false impression of how the module will work.
